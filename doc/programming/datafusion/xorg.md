xorq: Multi-engine ML pipelines made simple

https://github.com/xorq-labs/xorq?utm_source=tldrdata

xorq is a deferred computational framework that brings the replicability and performance of declarative pipelines to the Python ML ecosystem. It enables us to write pandas-style transformations that never run out of memory, automatically cache intermediate results, and seamlessly move between SQL engines and Python UDFsâ€”all while maintaining replicability. xorq is built on top of Ibis and DataFusion.
