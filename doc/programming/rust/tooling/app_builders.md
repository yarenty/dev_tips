# app_builders — Awesome App and the Rust desktop-packaging story

**Main link:** <https://awesomeapp.org/>

## Summary

[`Awesome App`](https://awesomeapp.org/) is a Rust template by Jeremy Chone for building desktop applications using [[tauri|Tauri]], [[../data/surrealdb|SurrealDB]] (embedded), and Native Web Components on the front end. It scaffolds a working app with backend Rust commands, an IPC bridge, an SQL-shaped local store, a Postcss/Rollup/TypeScript front-end pipeline, and the build wiring to produce a signed installer per OS. Use it as a starting template, not as a framework you depend on.

## Insight

The "build a desktop app in Rust" question splits into two: **the runtime** (which UI toolkit?) and **the packaging** (how do I ship a `.dmg` / `.msi` / `.AppImage` / `.deb` per platform that users can double-click?).

For the runtime, see the canonical [[../gui/tauri|gui/tauri]] (web-tech UI) or [[../gui/dioxus|dioxus]] / [[../gui/slint|slint]] / [[../gui/egui|egui]] for native-Rust UIs.

For packaging — the actual subject of "app builders" — the pieces are:

- **`cargo-bundle`** — the original "package my Rust binary as a platform-native installer" tool. Limited maintenance.
- **`cargo-tauri`** (Tauri's CLI) — the most-used answer if you went the web-tech UI route. Handles per-OS packaging (Apple notarisation, Windows code signing, Linux AppImage/deb/rpm) within the Tauri workflow.
- **`cargo-deb`** / **`cargo-rpm`** / **`cargo-generate-rpm`** — single-distro Linux packaging for a plain Rust binary.
- **`cargo-binstall`** — installs precompiled binaries from GitHub releases (the "I don't want to compile your CLI from source" answer for end users).
- **`cargo-zigbuild`** / **`cross`** — cross-compile from one OS to another. zigbuild is currently the most-loved approach because Zig handles the cross-libc problem well.
- **`cargo-dist`** (axodotdev) — opinionated end-to-end release CI: builds for every triple, signs, uploads to GitHub releases, generates an installer script. The most modern story for CLI tools.

`Awesome App` itself is the **Tauri + SurrealDB + native-WC opinion** for desktop apps. If that stack matches you, it's a useful starting template. If you want different DB / UI choices, lift the packaging wiring and ignore the rest.

**When to reach for what**:

- Shipping a CLI? → `cargo-dist` + `cargo-binstall`.
- Shipping a desktop app with web-tech UI? → `cargo-tauri` (with optional `Awesome App` template).
- Shipping a Linux-only daemon? → `cargo-deb` or `cargo-generate-rpm`.
- Cross-compiling for ARM / Windows / macOS from Linux CI? → `cargo-zigbuild` or `cross`.
