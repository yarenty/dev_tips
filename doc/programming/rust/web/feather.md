# Feather

https://github.com/BersisSe/feather?utm_source=tldrnewsletter


Feather is a lightweight, DX-first web framework for Rust — inspired by the simplicity of Express.js, but designed for Rust’s performance and safety.

## Why Feather?
- Middleware-First Architecture
Everything is a middleware — route handlers, auth, logging — all composable and clean

- Easy State Management Using Context
Recently implemented the Context API that makes it very easy to manage state without the use of Extractors/Macros

- Developer Experience First
Feather’s API is minimal, ergonomic, and readable

- Modular and Extensible
Feather is designed to be Modular. Select only the features you need and use. What you don't use you don't pay for.

- Great Tooling Out Of the Box
With the use of the Feather-CLI creating API's and Web Servers becomes a Breeze.
