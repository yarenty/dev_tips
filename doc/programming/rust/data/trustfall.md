# Trustfall — query engine over arbitrary data sources

**Main link:** <https://github.com/obi1kenobi/trustfall>

## Summary

Trustfall is a query engine for **any kind of data source** — APIs, databases, files on disk, GitHub repos, RSS feeds, even AI models — created by Predrag Gruevski (also the author of `cargo-semver-checks`, which is itself built on Trustfall). You write GraphQL-like queries with extra constructs (filters, recursion, type coercions), implement an `Adapter` trait that yields an iterator of vertices and edges from your data source, and Trustfall handles the rest. The model is closer to a **GraphQL-over-anything** layer than to a SQL or graph DB.

## Insight

Reach for Trustfall when you have **structured data scattered across heterogeneous sources** and want a single query language that joins across them — the canonical demo is `cargo-semver-checks`, which queries Rust crate ASTs to find breaking-change patterns; other adapters in the wild query HackerNews APIs, Wikipedia, RSS feeds, file-system trees, and crates.io metadata. Compared to GraphQL: Trustfall queries can recurse, filter on edges, and traverse arbitrary depth. Compared to graph databases (Neo4j / SurrealDB): Trustfall has no storage layer of its own — it's a *query engine*, you bring the data adapter. Compared to SQL: it's column-traversal-style rather than relational-algebra-style. Gotchas: adapter performance is entirely your responsibility (no automatic pushdown to the source); the query language has a learning curve even for SQL/GraphQL veterans; the project is small and one-maintainer.
