# LakeSoul — unified streaming + batch lakehouse format

**Main link:** <https://github.com/lakesoul-io/LakeSoul>

## Summary

**LakeSoul** is a cloud-native lakehouse framework (originally from DMetaSoul, China) that pitches itself as a unified streaming-and-batch table format with scalable metadata management, ACID transactions, efficient upserts, schema evolution, and unified streaming + batch processing. The compute story is multi-engine — Spark, Flink, Presto, PyTorch — and storage runs on HDFS or S3. The native I/O layer is written in Rust (the `lakesoul-io` crate) and integrates with DataFusion; the catalog and writer paths run on the JVM.

## Insight

LakeSoul slots into the **open table format** category alongside [[delta|Delta Lake]], [[iceberg|Apache Iceberg]], and Apache Hudi — but it's the least famous of the four, with mostly Chinese-language documentation and a much smaller English-speaking community. The honest framing for English-language readers in 2024-2025 is **watch, don't adopt**: the technical pitch (streaming + batch unification, AI-aware MPP support, PyTorch loader) is interesting and partly differentiated, but production references outside China are scarce and the lakehouse-format space is consolidating around Iceberg + Delta. Reach for it only if you already have a Chinese-ecosystem dependency or a specific feature gap that nothing else fills.

The differentiating bullet points worth knowing about:

- **Native (Rust) I/O layer** — the `lakesoul-io` crate uses Apache Arrow + DataFusion under the hood, which makes it cheaper than Delta/Iceberg to embed in non-JVM Rust services (in principle).
- **MPP + AI compute mode** — explicit support for PyTorch dataloaders alongside Spark/Flink/Presto SQL, framed as a lakehouse for ML training data.
- **Upsert-first design** — like Hudi, optimised for record-level upserts rather than overwrite-the-partition.
- **CDC-style streaming ingest** — primary use case in DMetaSoul deployments.

The competitive landscape is unforgiving: Iceberg has the multi-engine catalog story, Delta has Databricks' marketing weight, Hudi has the streaming/upsert lineage, and LakeSoul is competing with all three on overlapping axes with a fraction of the engineering bandwidth.
