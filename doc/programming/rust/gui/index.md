# Why Slint?

( From czkawka!!)

There are multiple reasons why I decided to use Slint as toolkit for Krokiet over other toolkits.

| Slint   | - Internal language is compiled to native code <br/> - Live gui preview with Vscode/Vscodium without needing to use rust <br/> - Full rust solution - easy to compile/cross compile, minimal runtime requirements </br> - Static type checks in slint files | - Internal .slint language is more limited than QML <br/> - Out of bounds and similar errors are quietly being corrected instead printing error - this can lead to hard to debug problems <br/> - Only GPL is only available open-source license <br/> - Popup windows almost not exists <br/> - Internal widgets are almost not customizable and usually quite limited </br> - Creating big/good looking with custom widgets gui is very hard                                                                                  |
| Iced    | - ~100% rust code - so compilation is simple </br> - Elm architecture - simple to understand                                                                                                                                                                | - Mostly maintained by one person - slows down fixing bugs and implementing new features </br> - GUI can be created only from rust code, which really is bad for creating complex GUIs(mostly due rust compile times)  </br> - Docs are almost non-existent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Tauri   | - Easy to create ui(at least for web developers) - uses html/css/js</br>- Quite portable                                                                                                                                                                    | - Webview dependency - it is not really lightweight and can be hard to compile on some platforms and on Linux e.g. webRTC not working</br>- Cannot select directory - file chooser only can choose files - small thing but important for me</br>- Not very performant Rust <=> Javascript communication (less problematic with [Tauri 2](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7170#issuecomment-1583279023)) </br> - Uses Javascript/Typescript which is a lot of harder to update/maintain than rust due being less strict |






  Since I don't have time to create really complex and good looking GUI, I needed a helper tool to create GUI not from Rust(I don't want to use different language, because this will make communication with czkawka_core harder) so I decided to not look at Iced which only allows to create GUI from Rust.



GTK and QT also I throw away due cross compilation problems caused mostly by using C/C++ internally. Using GTK in Czkawka was a reason why I started to find other toolkits.

Tauri - I don't really like to use Javascript because I already used it with Qt(C++) + QML + Typescript combination and I found that creating ui in such language may be simple at start but later any bigger changes cause a lot of runtime errors. Despite these problems, my next project(closed source), will just use Tauri + slint, because actually in that case it is rather the best option.

So only Slint left with its cons and pros.
