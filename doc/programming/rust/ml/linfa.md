# Linfa

**Main link:** <https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa>

## Summary

[`linfa`](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa) is the most mature
classical-ML toolkit for Rust — kin in spirit to Python's `scikit-learn`
and curated by the [rust-ml](https://github.com/rust-ml) working group.
It ships ~15 sub-crates covering clustering (K-Means, GMM, DBSCAN,
OPTICS), linear / logistic / elastic-net regression, decision trees,
SVMs, naive Bayes, hierarchical clustering, ICA, PCA, t-SNE, partial
least squares, follow-the-regularised-leader, plus pre-processing and
nearest-neighbour utilities. If your problem fits in scikit-learn's
"classical ML" box, linfa is the Rust answer.

## Insight

Reach for linfa when you want:

- A scikit-learn-shaped algorithm (k-means, logistic regression, PCA,
  decision trees, SVMs, naive Bayes, etc.) inside a Rust service or CLI.
- No Python runtime in your container / binary / firmware.
- Static typing, Cargo, and the Rust performance baseline (most
  algorithms are tested *and* benchmarked).

Reach for something else when:

- You need deep learning. Linfa is *classical* ML — see
  [[ml_in_rust]] for `candle`, `burn`, `tch-rs`, `dfdx`.
- You need scikit-learn's full breadth (xgboost, lightgbm, gradient
  boosting, exotic kernels, advanced model selection). Linfa's
  algorithm count is in the dozens, not hundreds. The honest fallback
  is `tch-rs` to call libtorch / a Python sidecar via [[pyo3]].
- You need GPU. Linfa is CPU-only; the GPU story in Rust ML is in
  [[cuda|cuda (Rust)]] and `candle`/`burn`.

A few practical notes:

- **Datasets**: `linfa::Dataset` wraps `ndarray::Array2` for features
  and a label vector. Most algorithms take and return `Dataset`s, which
  makes pipelines composable but requires you to learn `ndarray` first.
- **Backends**: linear algebra goes through `ndarray-linalg`, which
  needs a BLAS — `openblas-static`, `intel-mkl`, or system BLAS via
  feature flags. Pick one explicitly; a forgotten feature flag is the
  canonical first-build failure.
- **Status**: actively maintained but releases are infrequent. The
  algorithm matrix in the README is the source of truth for what's
  benchmarked vs merely tested.
- **Cross-link**: [smartcore](https://github.com/smartcorelib/smartcore)
  is a parallel project with overlapping goals and a slightly different
  algorithm set; check both if linfa is missing what you need.
