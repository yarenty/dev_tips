https://github.com/phidatahq/phidata/tree/main/cookbook/llm_os


This cookbook contains an initial implementation of the LLM OS proposed by karpathy. He talks about it in this tweet, this tweet and this video

## The LLM OS philosophy
- LLMs are the kernel process of an emerging operating system.
- This process (LLM) will solve problems by coordinating other resources (like memory or computation tools).
- The LLM OS Vision:

- [x] It can read/generate text
- [x] It has more knowledge than any single human about all subjects
- [x] It can browse the internet
- [ ] It can use existing software infra (calculator, python, mouse/keyboard)
- [ ] It can see and generate images and video
- [ ] It can hear and speak, and generate music
- [ ] It can think for a long time using a system 2
- [ ] It can “self-improve” in domains
- [ ] It can be customized and fine-tuned for specific tasks
- [x] It can communicate with other LLMs

[x] indicates functionality that is implemented in the LLM OS app
