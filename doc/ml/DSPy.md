DSPy is a declarative framework for building modular AI software. It allows you to iterate fast on structured code, rather than brittle strings, and offers algorithms that compile AI programs into effective prompts and weights for your language models, whether you're building simple classifiers, sophisticated RAG pipelines, or Agent loops.

Instead of wrangling prompts or training jobs, DSPy (Declarative Self-improving Python) enables you to build AI software from natural-language modules and to generically compose them with different models, inference strategies, or learning algorithms. This makes AI software more reliable, maintainable, and portable across models and strategies.

tl;dr Think of DSPy as a higher-level language for AI programming (lecture), like the shift from assembly to C or pointer arithmetic to SQL. Meet the community, seek help, or start contributing via GitHub and Discord.
