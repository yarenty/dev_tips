# skills.sh — installable agent skills

**Main link:** <https://skills.sh/>

## Summary

`skills.sh` (by Othman Adi) is a small registry + install tool that packages **reusable agent capabilities** ("skills") as install-with-one-command bundles you can drop into an AI agent's working environment. The pitch: agents need *procedural knowledge* (how-to-do-things), not just facts; skills are the unit of distribution. The flagship example is *planning-with-files* (a structured planning skill that uses files as scratchpad). Frame this as an early experiment in the same problem space that **Claude Skills** (Anthropic, 2025) and **MCP servers** address from different angles.

## Insight

When this is interesting: you want to give an agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Goose, Devin-style coding agents) a reusable, version-controlled bundle of **prompts + tool definitions + scratch-file conventions** for a specific workflow (planning, code review, research synthesis, content production). The mental model is closer to **shell aliases / dotfiles for agents** than to a full plugin system.

When it's not the right tool: anything you'd reach for **MCP** for (a server-side tool that the agent can call over a protocol — Anthropic's now-de-facto standard) — those are a different layer; MCP gives the agent a tool, skills.sh gives the agent a how-to-think prompt + file convention. They compose.

The honest framing: this whole space is **early and fragmenting fast** in late 2024 / 2025. Anthropic has shipped first-party **Claude Skills** (released as part of Claude Code / Projects); GitHub has its **GitHub Skills** product; MCP has overtaken the conversation as the cross-vendor standard for *tool* extensibility. `skills.sh` is one bottom-up community attempt at the same problem; durable enough to bookmark, but expect the canonical answer to be Anthropic's first-party Claude Skills + MCP servers within a year or two for most workflows.

The relationship to MCP: **MCP defines the protocol** (how an agent talks to an external tool/resource server), **skills.sh defines content** (a bundle of prompts + file layouts + tool-use patterns). An MCP server *exposes* tools; a skill *trains* an agent to use them in a structured way. Many real workflows want both.

### How it works (from the docs)

> Skills are reusable capabilities for AI agents. Install them with a single command to enhance your agents with access to procedural knowledge.

Install pattern:

```sh
npx skills add <owner/repo>
```

The skill is then available in the agent's working environment as a prompt + file convention bundle.

### Original tags from notes

`#skills` `#mcp` `#agent` `#llm` `#prompt` — keep these as the original author's tag set; they capture the orientation well (skills sit at the intersection of MCP-style tool extensibility, prompt engineering, and agent-runtime behaviour).
