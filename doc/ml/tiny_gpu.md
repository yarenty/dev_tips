# Tiny - GPU



https://github.com/adam-maj/tiny-gpu


A minimal GPU implementation in Verilog optimized for learning about how GPUs work from the ground up.

Built with <15 files of fully documented Verilog, complete documentation on architecture & ISA, working matrix addition/multiplication kernels, and full support for kernel simulation & execution traces.





tiny-gpu is a minimal GPU implementation optimized for learning about how GPUs work from the ground up.

Specifically, with the trend toward general-purpose GPUs (GPGPUs) and ML-accelerators like Google's TPU, tiny-gpu focuses on highlighting the general principles of all of these architectures, rather than on the details of graphics-specific hardware.
