The advent of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, paving the way for advanced intelligent agents capable of sophisticated reasoning, robust
perception, and versatile action across diverse domains. As these agents increasingly drive AI
research and practical applications, their design, evaluation, and continuous improvement present
intricate, multifaceted challenges. This survey provides a comprehensive overview, framing intelligent
agents within a modular, brain-inspired architecture that integrates principles from cognitive science,
neuroscience, and computational research. We structure our exploration into four interconnected
parts. First, we delve into the modular foundation of intelligent agents, systematically mapping
their cognitive, perceptual, and operational modules onto analogous human brain functionalities, and
elucidating core components such as memory, world modeling, reward processing, and emotion-like
systems. Second, we discuss self-enhancement and adaptive evolution mechanisms, exploring how
agents autonomously refine their capabilities, adapt to dynamic environments, and achieve continual
learning through automated optimization paradigms, including emerging AutoML and LLM-driven
optimization strategies. Third, we examine collaborative and evolutionary multi-agent systems,
investigating the collective intelligence emerging from agent interactions, cooperation, and societal
structures, highlighting parallels to human social dynamics. Finally, we address the critical imperative
of building safe, secure, and beneficial AI systems, emphasizing intrinsic and extrinsic security
threats, ethical alignment, robustness, and practical mitigation strategies necessary for trustworthy
real-world deployment. By synthesizing modular AI architectures with insights from different disciplines, this survey identifies key research gaps, challenges, and opportunities, encouraging innovations
that harmonize technological advancement with meaningful societal benefit. The projectâ€™s Github
