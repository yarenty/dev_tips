ANEMLL (pronounced like "animal") is an open-source project focused on accelerating the porting of Large Language Models (LLMs) to tensor processors, starting with the Apple Neural Engine (ANE).

## Goals
The goal is to provide a fully open-source pipeline from model conversion to inference for common LLM architectures running on ANE. This enables seamless integration and on-device inference for low-power applications on edge devices, ensuring maximum privacy and security. This is critical for autonomous applications, where models run directly on the device without requiring an internet connection.

## We aim to:

Provide flexible and easy to use library/framework to port LLMs to ANE directly from Hugging Face models
Provide on-device examples for iOS and macOS swift or C/C++ Applications
