Activeloop Deep Lake
Use Cases for Deep Lake
Deep Lake as a Data Lake For Deep Learning
Store and organize unstructured data (images, audios, nifti, videos, text, metadata, and more) in a versioned data format optimized for Deep Learning performance.

Rapidly query and visualize your data in order to create optimal training sets.

Stream training data from your cloud to multiple GPUs, without any copying or bottlenecks.

Deep Lake as a Vector Store for RAG Applications
Store and search embeddings and their metadata including text, jsons, images, audio, video, and more. Save the data locally, in your cloud, or on Deep Lake storage.

Build Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Apps using our integrations with LangChain and LlamaIndex

Run computations locally or on our Managed Tensor Database
