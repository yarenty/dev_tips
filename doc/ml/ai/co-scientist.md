## Empowering scientists and accelerating discoveries with the AI co-scientist
Given a scientist’s research goal that has been specified in natural language, the AI co-scientist is designed to generate novel research hypotheses, a detailed research overview, and experimental protocols. To do so, it uses a coalition of specialized agents — Generation, Reflection, Ranking, Evolution, Proximity and Meta-review — that are inspired by the scientific method itself. These agents use automated feedback to iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine hypotheses, resulting in a self-improving cycle of increasingly high-quality and novel outputs.

- Crow is a general-purpose agent that can search the literature and provide concise, scholarly answers to questions, and is perfect for use via API.

- Falcon is specialized for deep literature reviews. It can search and synthesize more scientific literature than any other agent we are aware of, and also has access to several specialized scientific databases, like OpenTargets.

- Owl (formerly HasAnyone) is specialized to answer the question “Has anyone done X before?”

- Phoenix (experimental) is our deployment of ChemCrow, an agent with access to specialized tools that allow it to help researchers in planning chemistry experiments.
