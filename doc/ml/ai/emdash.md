Emdash

emdash is a cross-platform UI layer for running multiple coding agents in parallel â€” currently supporting OpenAI Codex CLI, Claude Code CLI, Droid (Factory CLI), Gemini CLI, Cursor CLI, Amp Code CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, and Charm CLI. Each agent runs in its own Git worktree so you can fan out tasks, keep changes compartmentalized, and manage everything from a single UI.
