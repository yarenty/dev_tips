Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is an architecture that provides the most relevant and contextually-important proprietary, private or dynamic data to your Generative AI application's large language model (LLM) when it is performing tasks to enhance its accuracy and performance.

What is RAG in AI / LLM?
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in AI is a technique that leverages a database to fetch the most contextually relevant results that match the user's query at generation time.

Products built on top of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude are brilliant yet flawed. Powerful as they are, current LLMs suffer from several drawbacks:

They are static - LLMs are “frozen in time” and lack up-to-date information. It is not feasible to update their gigantic training datasets.
They lack domain-specific knowledge - LLMs are trained for generalized tasks, meaning they do not know your company’s private data.
They function as “black boxes” - it’s not easy to understand which sources an LLM was considering when they arrived at their conclusions.
They are inefficient and costly to produce - Few organizations have the financial and human resources to produce and deploy foundation models.
Unfortunately, these issues affect the accuracy of GenAI applications leveraging LLMs. For any business application with requirements more demanding than your average chatbot demo, LLMs used “out of the box” with no modifications aside from prompting will perform poorly at context-dependent tasks, such as helping customers book their next flight.

This post will examine why Retrieval Augmented Generation is the preferred method for addressing these drawbacks, provide a deep dive into how RAG works, and explain why most companies use RAG to boost their GenAI applications’ performance.
