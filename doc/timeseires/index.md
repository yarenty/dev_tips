Explainable Forecasting at Scale
NeuralProphet bridges the gap between traditional time-series models and deep learning methods. It's based on PyTorch and can be installed using pip.

```python
from neuralprophet import NeuralProphet
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('toiletpaper_daily_sales.csv')

m = NeuralProphet()

metrics = m.fit(df, freq="D")

forecast = m.predict(df)
```
