_This is like object oriented DB_

EdgeDB is a next-generation graph-relational database designed as a spiritual successor to the relational database.

It inherits the strengths of SQL databases: type safety, performance, reliability, and transactionality.
But instead of modeling data in a relational (tabular) way, EdgeDB represents data with object types containing properties and links to other objects. 
It leverages this object-oriented model to provide a superpowered query language that solves some of SQL’s biggest usability problems.


A GRAPH-LIKE SCHEMA  WITH A RELATIONAL CORE

The core unit of schema in the graph-relational model is the object type—analogous to a table in SQL.
Object types contain properties and can be linked to other object types to form a schema graph.
