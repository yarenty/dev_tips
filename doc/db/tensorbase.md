What is TensorBase
TensorBase is a new big data warehousing with modern efforts.

TensorBase is building on top of Rust, Apache Arrow and Arrow DataFusion.

TensorBase hopes to change the status quo of bigdata system as follows:

low efficiency (in the name of 'scalable')
hard to use (for end users) and understand (for developers)
not evolving with modern infrastructures (OS, hardware, engineering...)
Features
Out-of-the-box to play ( get started just now )
Lighting fast architectural performance in Rust ( real-world benchmarks )
Modern redesigned columnar storage
Top performance network transport server
ClickHouse compatible syntax
Green installation with DBA-Free ops
Reliability and high availability (WIP)
Cluster (WIP)
Cloud-Native Adaptation (WIP)
Arrow dataLake (...)
