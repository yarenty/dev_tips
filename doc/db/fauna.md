The distributed serverless database
Fauna combines the flexibility of NoSQL with the relational querying capabilities and ACID consistency of SQL systems — with native GraphQL and delivered as a cloud API so you don’t have to worry about operations.



Build applications faster
- Start quickly with document-centric data model, powerful relational capabilities, and event streaming
- Run sophisticated business logic centrally in the context of your data
- Connectionless access via HTTPS and attribute-driven security down to the document
- Interface directly from the client using GraphQL or with drivers for your favorite language

Document-relational
- Combine the flexibility and familiarity of JSON documents with the relationships and querying power of a traditional relational database
- Store data as documents to write different data shapes to a collection
- Query your database using relational features like foreign keys, views, and joins 
- Reduce complexity in your application code by executing business logic on your data directly in your database



User defined functions (UDFs)
- Write business logic using user-defined functions in your database with Fauna Query Language (FQL)
- Call UDFs directly in GraphQL using custom resolvers
- Reduce time to get started with built-in functions for common queries and build your own functions using UDFs
