## With Quary, engineers can:
- ðŸ”Œ Connect to their Database
- ðŸ“– Write SQL queries to transform, organize, and document tables in a database
- ðŸ“Š Create charts, dashboards and reports (in development)
- ðŸ§ª Test, collaborate & refactor iteratively through version control
- ðŸš€ Deploy the organised, documented model back up to the database


## Asset Types in Quary
Define and manage the following asset types as code:

- Sources: Define the external data sources that feed into Quary, such as database tables, flat files, or APIs (with DuckDB).
- Models: Transform raw data from sources into analysis-ready datasets using SQL, this lets engineers split complex queries into atomic components.
- Charts: Create visual representations of your data using SQL.
- ðŸš§ Dashboards (WIP): Combine multiple charts into a single view, allowing engineers to monitor and analyze data in one place.
- ðŸš§ Reports (WIP): Create detailed reports to share insights and findings with your team or stakeholders.
