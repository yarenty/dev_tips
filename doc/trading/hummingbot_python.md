Hummingbot is an open source framework that helps you build automated trading strategies, or bots that run on cryptocurrency exchanges.

This code is free and publicly available under the Apache 2.0 open source license!

Why Hummingbot?
Both CEX and DEX connectors: Hummingbot supports connectors to centralized exchanges like Binance and KuCoin, as well as decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap on various blockchains (Ethereum, BNB Chain, etc).
Cutting edge strategy framework: Our new V2 Strategies framework allows you to compose powerful, backtestable, multi-venue, multi-timeframe stategies of any type
Secure local client: Hummingbot is a local client software that you install and run on your own devices or cloud virtual machines. It encrypts your API keys and private keys and never exposes them to any third parties.
Community focus: Hummingbot is driven by a global community of quant traders and developers who maintain the connectors and contribute strategies to the codebase.
Help us democratize high-frequency trading and make powerful trading algorithms accessible to everyone in the world!
