KAG is a logical reasoning and Q&A framework based on the OpenSPG engine and large language models, which is used to build logical reasoning and Q&A solutions for vertical domain knowledge bases. KAG can effectively overcome the ambiguity of traditional RAG vector similarity calculation and the noise problem of GraphRAG introduced by OpenIE. KAG supports logical reasoning and multi-hop fact Q&A, etc., and is significantly better than the current SOTA method.

The goal of KAG is to build a knowledge-enhanced LLM service framework in professional domains, supporting logical reasoning, factual Q&A, etc. KAG fully integrates the logical and factual characteristics of the KGs. Its core features include:

Knowledge and Chunk Mutual Indexing structure to integrate more complete contextual text information
Knowledge alignment using conceptual semantic reasoning to alleviate the noise problem caused by OpenIE
Schema-constrained knowledge construction to support the representation and construction of domain expert knowledge
Logical form-guided hybrid reasoning and retrieval to support logical reasoning and multi-hop reasoning Q&A
