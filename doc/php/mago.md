Blazing fast linter, formatter, and static analyzer for PHP, written in Rust.



Mago is a complete toolchain for PHP, written in Rust, designed from the ground up for maximum performance. It includes:

- A blazing-fast formatter that automatically formats your code according to PSR-12, ending style debates forever.
- An intelligent linter that catches stylistic issues, inconsistencies, and code smells before they become problems.
- A powerful static analyzer that finds type errors and logical bugs in your code without you ever having to run it.
