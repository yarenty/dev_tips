# HyperFS

https://crates.io/crates/hyperfs

A simple HTTP server for static files.

HyperFS is a very simple http server that simply serves the files in the directory it is run from. It is primarily intended as a development tool similar to using python -m SimpleHTTPServer. But it is a single lightweight executable written in rust.

To be honest, part of the motivation was to just so I could try out rust.



# Rewquest

https://crates.io/crates/reqwest

An ergonomic, batteries-included HTTP Client for Rust.

- Plain bodies, JSON, urlencoded, multipart
- Customizable redirect policy
- HTTP Proxies
- HTTPS via system-native TLS (or optionally, rustls)
