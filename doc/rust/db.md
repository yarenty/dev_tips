# diesel

Diesel - A safe, extensible ORM and Query Builder for Rust
Diesel is the most productive way to interact with databases in Rust because of its safe and composable abstractions over queries.


https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/2.0.x


Diesel gets rid of the boilerplate for database interaction and eliminates runtime errors without sacrificing performance. It takes full advantage of Rust's type system to create a low overhead query builder that "feels like Rust."

Supported databases:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
  -SQLite

You can configure the database backend in Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
diesel = { version = "<version>", features = ["<postgres|mysql|sqlite>"] }
```

Powerful SQL migration toolkit for Rust

# rusqlite

https://crates.io/crates/rusqlite

Rusqlite is an ergonomic wrapper for using SQLite from Rust.

# barrel

https://crates.io/crates/barrel

A powerful database schema builder, that lets you write your SQL migrations in Rust!

barrel offers callback-style builder functions for SQL migrations and is designed to be flexible, portable and fun to use. It provides you with a common interface over SQL, with additional database-specific builders.

```rust
use barrel::{types, Migration};
use barrel::backend::Pg;

fn main() {
    let mut m = Migration::new();

    m.create_table("users", |t| {
        t.add_column("name", types::varchar(255));
        t.add_column("age", types::integer());
        t.add_column("owns_plushy_sharks", types::boolean());
    });

    println!("{}", m.make::<Pg>());
}
```


# GlueSQL

https://crates.io/crates/gluesql


GlueSQL is a SQL database library written in Rust.
It provides a parser (sqlparser-rs), execution layer, and optional storages (sled or memory) packaged into a single library.
Developers can choose to use GlueSQL to build their own SQL database, or as an embedded SQL database using the default storage engine.



# sqlparser

https://crates.io/crates/sqlparser

The goal of this project is to build a SQL lexer and parser capable of parsing SQL that conforms with the ANSI/ISO SQL standard while also making it easy to support custom dialects so that this crate can be used as a foundation for vendor-specific parsers.

This parser is currently being used by the DataFusion query engine, LocustDB, Ballista and GlueSQL.

This crate provides only a syntax parser, and tries to avoid applying any SQL semantics, and accepts queries that specific databases would reject, even when using that Database's specific Dialect. For example, CREATE TABLE(x int, x int) is accepted by this crate, even though most SQL engines will reject this statement due to the repeated column name x.
