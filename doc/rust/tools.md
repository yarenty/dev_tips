# ripgrep

By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. ripgrep has first class support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with binary downloads available for every release. ripgrep is similar to other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep.

# BAT

Like cat but with syntax highlights of displaying unvisibles

https://crates.io/crates/bat

A cat(1) clone with wings.


# EXA

new ls


https://crates.io/crates/exa

exa is a modern replacement for the venerable file-listing command-line program ls that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And itâ€™s small, fast, and just one single binary.

By deliberately making some decisions differently, exa attempts to be a more featureful, more user-friendly version of ls. For more information, see exaâ€™s website.

# topgrade

https://github.com/r-darwish/topgrade

Keeping your system up to date usually involves invoking multiple package managers. This results in big, non-portable shell one-liners saved in your shell. To remedy this, topgrade detects which tools you use and runs the appropriate commands to update them.




# Bandwhich

https://crates.io/crates/bandwhich

This is a CLI utility for displaying current network utilization by process, connection and remote IP/hostname

How does it work?
bandwhich sniffs a given network interface and records IP packet size, cross referencing it with the /proc filesystem on linux, lsof on macOS, or using WinApi on windows. It is responsive to the terminal window size, displaying less info if there is no room for it. It will also attempt to resolve ips to their host name in the background using reverse DNS on a best effort basis.

# armada

TCP scanner

https://github.com/resyncgg/armada

Armada is a high performance TCP SYN scanner. This is equivalent to the type of scanning that nmap might perform when you use the -sS scan type. Armada's main goal is to answer the basic question "Is this port open?". It is then up to you, or your tooling, to dig further to identify what an open port is for.





# watchexec

Automatically run unit tests
Run linters/syntax checkers
Features
Simple invocation and use, does not require a cryptic command line involving xargs
Runs on OS X, Linux, and Windows
Monitors current directory and all subdirectories for changes
Coalesces multiple filesystem events into one, for editors that use swap/backup files during saving
Loads .gitignore and .ignore files
Uses process groups to keep hold of forking programs
Provides the paths that changed in environment variables
Does not require a language runtime, not tied to any particular language or ecosystem
And more!
