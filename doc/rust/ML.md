## ndarray

https://crates.io/crates/ndarray

Array manipulation like numpy

ndarray implements an n-dimensional container for general elements and for numerics.

In n-dimensional we include for example 1-dimensional rows or columns, 2-dimensional matrices, and higher dimensional arrays. If the array has n dimensions, then an element in the array is accessed by using that many indices. Each dimension is also called an axis.


- Generic n-dimensional array
- Slicing, also with arbitrary step size, and negative indices to mean elements from the end of the axis.
- Views and subviews of arrays; iterators that yield subviews.
- Higher order operations and arithmetic are performant
- Array views can be used to slice and mutate any [T] data using ArrayView::from and ArrayViewMut::from.
- Zip for lock step function application across two or more arrays or other item producers (NdProducer trait).




## AI kit

https://lib.rs/crates/ai_kit

AI_Kit aims to be a single dependency for various classic AI algorithms.

Core project goals are:

convenient and ergonomic interfaces to various algorithms by building around traits.
only build what you need through the use of feature flags
performance
easy to understand implementations
All of the algorithms (documented below) operate on several core traits, BindingsValue, Unify, Operation.

ai_kit provides optional data structures that implement these traits, allowing all algorithms to be usable out of the box - see Datum and Rule. Quick examples are provided before, followed by more in-depth documentation.




## Big brain


https://lib.rs/crates/big-brain


big-brain is a Utility AI library for games, built for the Bevy Game Engine

It lets you define complex, intricate AI behaviors for your entities based on their perception of the world. Definitions are heavily data-driven, using plain Rust, and you only need to program Scorers (entities that look at your game world and come up with a Score), and Actions (entities that perform actual behaviors upon the world). No other code is needed for actual AI behavior.

See the documentation for more details.

Features
Highly concurrent/parallelizable evaluation.
Integrates smoothly with Bevy.
Easy AI definition using idiomatic Rust builders. You don't have to be some genius to define behavior that feels realistic to players.
High performance--supports hundreds of thousands of concurrent AIs.
Graceful degradation--can be configured such that the less frame time is available, the slower an AI might "seem", without dragging down framerates, by simply processing fewer events per tick.
Proven game AI model.
Low code overhead--you only define two types of application-dependent things, and everything else is building blocks!
Highly composable and reusable.
State machine-style continuous actions/behaviors.
Action cancellation.
Example
As a developer, you write application-dependent code to define Scorers and Actions, and then put it all together like building blocks, using Thinkers that will define the actual behavior.

## Liquid ML

https://crates.io/crates/liquid-ml

LiquidML is a platform for distributed, scalable data analysis for data sets too large to fit into memory on a single machine. It aims to be easy and simple to use, allowing users to easily create their own map and filter operations, leaving everything else to liquid_ml. It ships with many example uses, including the decision tree and random forest machine learning algorithms built in, showing the power and ease of use of the platform.

LiquidML is written in Rust for both performance and safety reasons, allowing many optimizations to be made more easily without the risk of a memory safety bug. This helps guarantee security around our clients' data, as many memory safety bugs can be exploited by malicious hackers.

LiquidML is currently in the state of an MVP. Tools on top of LiquidML can built and several examples are included in this crate to demonstrate various use cases.


## Easy ML



https://github.com/Skeletonxf/easy-ml

This is a pure Rust library which makes heavy use of passing closures, iterators, generic types, and other rust idioms that machine learning libraries which wrap around another language backend could never provide easily. This library tries to provide adequate documentation to explain what the functions compute, what the computations mean, and examples of tasks you might want to do with this library:

Linear Regression
k-means Clustering
Logistic Regression
Na√Øve Bayes
Feedforward neural networks
Backprop with Automatic Differentiation
using a custom numeric type such as num_bigint::BigInt
Handwritten digit recognition in the browser
This library is not designed for deep learning. The implementations of everything are more or less textbook mathematical definitions, and do not feature extensive optimisation. You might find that you need to use a faster library once you've explored your problem, or that you need something that's not implemented here and have to switch. I hope that being able to at least start here may be of use.

## Bert

https://crates.io/crates/rust-bert

Rust-native state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing models and pipelines. Port of Hugging Face's Transformers library, using the tch-rs crate and pre-processing from rust-tokenizers. Supports multi-threaded tokenization and GPU inference. This repository exposes the model base architecture, task-specific heads (see below) and ready-to-use pipelines. Benchmarks are available at the end of this document.

Get started with tasks including question answering, named entity recognition, translation, summarization, text generation, conversational agents and more in just a few lines of code:
```rust
    let qa_model = QuestionAnsweringModel::new(Default::default())?;
                                                        
    let question = String::from("Where does Amy live ?");
    let context = String::from("Amy lives in Amsterdam");

    let answers = qa_model.predict(&[QaInput { question, context }], 1, 32);
```    
Output:
```log
[Answer { score: 0.9976, start: 13, end: 21, answer: "Amsterdam" }]
```

The tasks currently supported include:

- Translation
- Summarization
- Multi-turn dialogue
- Zero-shot classification
- Sentiment Analysis
- Named Entity Recognition
- Part of Speech tagging
- Question-Answering
