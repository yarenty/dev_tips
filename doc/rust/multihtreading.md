Rayon is a data-parallelism library for Rust. It is extremely lightweight and makes it easy to convert a sequential computation into a parallel one. It also guarantees data-race freedom. (You may also enjoy this blog post about Rayon, which gives more background and details about how it works, or this video, from the Rust Belt Rust conference.) Rayon is available on crates.io, and API Documentation is available on docs.rs.
