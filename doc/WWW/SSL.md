## TODO

- No `main_link` could be auto-detected. Add the canonical URL (project homepage / repo / paper) to the frontmatter.
- Write a real `## Summary` (2-5 sentences) replacing the auto-stub placeholder.
- Write a real `## Insight` (when/why/where to use) replacing the auto-stub placeholder.
- Add 3-5 entries under `## Similar / related topics`.
- Add `[[wikilinks]]` to at least 2 related articles in the vault under `## Internal links`.
- Promote `status: draft` to `status: reviewed` once the rewrite is complete.
