fluent-templates lets you to easily integrate Fluent localisation into your Rust application or library. It does this by providing a high level "loader" API that loads fluent strings based on simple language negotiation, and the FluentLoader struct which is a Loader agnostic container type that comes with optional trait implementations for popular templating engines such as handlebars or tera that allow you to be able to use your localisations in your templates with no boilerplate.
