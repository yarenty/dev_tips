No dependencies
Zola comes as a single executable with Sass compilation, syntax highlighting, table of contents and many other features that traditionally require setting up a dev environment or adding some JavaScript libraries to your site.

Blazing fast
The average site will be generated in less than a second, including Sass compilation and syntax highlighting.

Scalable
Zola renders your whole site as static files, making it trivial to handle any kind of traffic you will throw at it at no cost without having to worry about managing a server or a database.

Easy to use
From the CLI to the template engine, everything is designed to be intuitive. Don't take my word for it though, look at the documentation and see for yourself.

Flexible
Zola gets out of your way so you can focus on your content, be it a blog, a knowledge base, a landing page or a combination of them.

Augmented Markdown
Zola comes with shortcodes and internal links to make it easier to write your content.
