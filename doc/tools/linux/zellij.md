# Zellij
A batteries-included Tmux alternative, Zellij doesn’t need any configuration to work well. You can set up Layouts without additional plugins (although there is a plugin system) and I’m generally not missing anything from my Tmux configuration.

My favorite feature is the floating panes. Press Ctrl + p, w to toggle a pane floating on top of everything else—I often use this for Lazygit.
