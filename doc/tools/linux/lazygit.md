# Lazygit
After raving about Magit in London, my team showed me Lazygit and I’ve been using it ever since—it’s really good and it does exactly what you want it to do, without configuration3.

You can toggle different screen modes, panes adjust in size when active and pretty much everything you want to do is only a few keystrokes away.
