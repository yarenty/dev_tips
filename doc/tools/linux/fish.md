# Fish
Julia Evans recently posted Reasons I still love the fish shell, and the first point she makes is “no configuration”.

Things that require plugins and lots of code in shells like ZSH, like autosuggestions, are included and configured by default in fish. At the time of writing this, my fish config has less than 31 loc, most of which are abbreviations.

I have two fish plugins configured: z for jumping to a directory, and hydro as my shell prompt. Neither need configuration.
