# Pake

https://github.com/tw93/Pake

Pake supports Mac, Windows, and Linux. Check out README for Popular Packages, Command-Line Packaging, and Customized Development information. Feel free to share your suggestions in Discussions.


## Features
- 
- 🎐 Nearly 20 times smaller than an Electron package (around 5M!)
- 🚀 With Rust Tauri, Pake is much more lightweight and faster than JS-based frameworks.
- 📦 Battery-included package — shortcut pass-through, immersive windows, and minimalist customization.
- 👻 Pake is just a simple tool — replace the old bundle approach with Tauri (though PWA is good enough).
