# Insights

List of tools, technologies and areas of interest which, till now, I kept as open tabs on my browser as "to investigate/ to read/ to do ...", and never really have time check.
Also - list of tips / tricks how to use them, switch  on/off, extend ...



## Procedure
- Investigation:
  - spent 5 min for investigation - copy materials
  - spent 5 min for "summary", how/and what can I do with it
  - clean my tabs! ;-)

- Tools:
  - install - write how to install
  - enhance/extends with whatever plugins it has - write how to do it
  - add tips how to use 


## Structure:
- doc - contains raw material - output of short investigation with links etc..
- published - copy of published insights (mostly on yarenty.blogspot.com)
